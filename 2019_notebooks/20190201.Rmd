#2019/02/06

**- Dept DEI**

Generated several figures based on the three questions belows & finished a rough draft of the presentation.

I'd like to know the demographics of our current grad students & postdocs. Does who they see match who they are? Perhaps work that into the introduction. -- only 20% of trainees are WM

Also need to address the idea of representational vs aspirational -- balance the workload & the recognition

#2019/02/05

**- Dept DEI**

Worked on choosing visualizations for the faculty mtg presentation. Key question is: what do I want to show?

1. Is work distributed equally - e.g. how many faculty are hosting multiple times? What are those demographics?

2. What are the proportions of M/F, W/POC for invited speakers?

3. What are the proportions for lectureships?

Outline:
  + Introduction - DEI session at the retreat - Josie
  + Why does speaker diversity matter? - Ada/Josie
  + Methods - where did the data come from/demographic assignments - Ada
  + Results - demographic stats, lectureship stats
  + Conclusions - suggestions for improving speaker diversity moving forward

**- Lab meeting**

`ggplot(aes(x, color, y))+ geom_jitter(position=position_jitterdodge(jitter.width=0.1))`

**- Authorship paper**

Finished revising the genderize results section and added discussions of the editor comparison data and the countries with high proportion of na-gendered names from the full dataset.

**-ASM blog**

Made a few more tweaks to the non-ac careers post & sent off to Julie!

#2019/02/04

**- Authorship paper**

Read Bravo, et al., 2019 -- interestingly, they found that open peer review increased the objectivity and positivity of reviews from men.

Uploaded the new dataset to Box for Mia.

Started draft of "paper-in-progress" for the ASM representation paper

Worked on revising genderize results with updated validation dataset. Overall, the accuracy dropped a bit when I removed special characters, but the proportion of names that were assigned genders increased.

**- ASM blog**

Revised non-acc careers post & found new links.

Suggestions for Rita's post.

Completed IDP.

Arranged for dinner w. Amy.

Emailed Bonnie about Reimbursement.

Re-started genderize script + workflow to change special characters & generate new `ready.csv` files for analysis.

Started B_C analysis w/ & w/o changing special characters to compare accuracy. -- done

Showed genderize impact chart to Begum, she suggested dropping any countries with a positive impact on gender assignment (negative impact on the graph, e.g., USA) & instead mentioning them in the text. 

**- Mia**

Car won't start, working from home.

**- "Git" Coffee w. Ari**

Apparently, she missed the git section w. Josh so I gave her an overview & got her started. We'll probably meet again to get her repos set up on GitHub.
