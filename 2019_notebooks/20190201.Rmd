**- Authorship paper**

Read Bravo, et al., 2019 -- interestingly, they found that open peer review increased the objectivity and positivity of reviews from men.

Uploaded the new dataset to Box for Mia.

Started draft of "paper-in-progress" for the ASM representation paper

Worked on revising genderize results with updated validation dataset. Overall, the accuracy dropped a bit when I removed special characters, but the proportion of names that were assigned genders increased.

Revised non-acc careers post & found new links.

Suggestions for Rita's post.

Completed IDP.

Re-started genderize script + workflow to change special characters & generate new `ready.csv` files for analysis.

Started B_C analysis w/ & w/o changing special characters to compare accuracy. -- done

Showed genderize impact chart to Begum, she suggested dropping any countries with a positive impact on gender assignment (negative impact on the graph, e.g., USA) & instead mentioning them in the text. 

**- Mia**

Car won't start, working from home.

**- "Git" Coffee w. Ari**

Apparently, she missed the git section w. Josh so I gave her an overview & got her started. We'll probably meet again to get her repos set up on GitHub.
