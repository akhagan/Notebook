#2019/02/13

**- AAAS**

Found & downloaded app for the meeting. Will work on sessions later.

**- Authorship paper**

Printed off several papers to read through on my trip.

Continued streamlining code -- this time by creating plot functions.

Trying to figure out how to create a df that has the data for each year & journal, that way I can facet_wrap by journal --- one problem is that not all journals have all years. Might need to create a separate function altogether

**-ASM blog**

Addressed more comments, including new title :(
    
#2019/02/12

**- XML parse**

Cleaned up github files

**- Lab Meeting**

Goal in writing code & using github -- to be able to burn files, git pull, & run a MAKE file to generate the end paper.

How can we revamp code review?

R studio has a spell check ???

```{r}
#community mouse1day1 (phylum)-- piechart
data %>% filter(Level == "Phylum", day == 1, mouse == 1) %>% 
  group_by(Classification) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = 1, fill = Classification, y = n))+
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity")+
  coord_polar(theta = "y")+
  theme_void()
```

**- Seminar**

**- Authorship Paper**

Work on gender representation figures. --- streamlined the code by adding setup scripts for authors & gatekeepers, made functions to split out author types & to generate dfs with n & proportion counts by year for specific column types.

Need to think about how I want to present the aggreggate numbers -- currently unique by year, but potentially duplicated across years. Probably want to just have unique regardless of year??

#2019/02/11

#2019/02/08

**- DEI symposium**

Taylor Cox, President of Morehouse - structural/organizational diversity

Mike Nettles, Walter (black social sci scholars) "Three magic letters, ph.d."

"Resilent folks don't focus on what they don't have, they focus on what they do have"-- book on resilence of inner city kids

"visualization of the diffusion of innovation model" -- google image search -- difficult to "convert" resistors one-on-one. Identify where people are on the spectrum

"Managing change" & "managing the diffusion of change/innovation"

Make it optional, but make it accountable & public -- people can see who's falling behind & who's moving forward

spend more time on the _activation_ of the toolkit, so it can be disseminated appropriately. toolkit -- simple, mvp (minimal viable product) -- Time is inbalanced focusing on the design as opposed to the implimentation

upwork.com -- global talent searching platform -- Research scientist w. analysis of DEI -- Williams business

thought leadership - thought leader, finding organizations to spread your ideas -- what is the problem that you can take away from a client

Damon A. Williams, Keynote: @DAWPHD

You didn't come to UM to play it small & be a contributor -- you came to be an innovator

Connection economy --not just citizens, but citizen brands. We're not just a scholar, not just advocate -- think of ourselves as a brand.

What does it mean to be an innovator? We live in a time of innovation - idea to product faster now than ever before. "The innovator's DNA"

What makes an innovator an innovator? -- do you embody these characterisitcs?
  1. Questioning -- poking the box
      + leaders can't find greatness until there is a community to push them there
  2. Solutions Across Boundaries -- look for solutions whereever you can find them, innovators do not live confined w/in a field
  3. Engaging other innovators -- innovation rarely happens in solo, isolated efforts, it happens at the intersection of community and networks -- culture of peer critique from the very first day! That's a major diff btwn arts & bio -- that's what it takes to level up
  Self-directed, self-authored, I get up and push it to the max not b/c anyone asked me to but b/c I want to
  4. Experimenting w. New Ideas -- Innovators have a bias toward action 
  5. Taking ideas to scale -- when innovators figure out what works, they scale it up & go big. Don't just do it once, do it over & over & over again
  "Commitment w.out currency is counterfeit. Don't let anyone tell you different."
  "the ability & willingness not just to lead change, but ask hard questions, find solutions, scale up"
  6. Leading with Courage -- too often we are not courages, we live our lives in fear of who we are not, of what others think of us -- every day courage drives: a culture of inclusive excellence
    + the courage to be humble
    + writing is an act of polishing, research is an act of struggle
    + courage to build new relationships
    + courage to coach, mentor & sponsor difference -- always seeking out coaches, mentors & sponsors -- sponsors pick up the phone, send a note, make a call -- POC have coaches & mentors, but what about sponsors??
    + courage to continue to challenge priviledge & bias -- create spaces for true dialouge, scale up to include others regardless of background
    + courage to servant lead -- success is what you do for yourself, great is what you do to spark change for someone else
    + courage to be original

Simon Sinek -- "golden circle"
  + don't start with what or how, they start w. WHY -- articulate the burning questions that will carry you through your purpose & career
  + we are the most diverse generation ever
  
Voice, Choice, Access, & Passion: Preparing the Centennials to Lead
  1. Passion & Purpose -- what sparks  you?
  2. Voice & agency 
  3. Growth mindset -- progress is incremental
  4. Grit & resilience -- have to go through the fire
  5. Personal brand & character -- constantly building & protecting your brand -- who are you & what do you stand for to others?
  
  1. Academic credentials & experiences
  2. High impact leadership development experiences
  3. mentoring & learning relationships
  4. Role models & avoidance models -- reverse engineer how they got there
  5. Health & wellness plan
  
+ people think the research is the work, it's not, it's the project that gets you the data to have the impact to find solutions and make the change

+ "The beautiful constraint" -- the world is filled w. constriants - the innovators find opportunity to work within the constrainst - mindsets of abundance & success, high level understanding from mapping it out & reverse engineering the solution
  
Sellers: Reasons to contribute to DEI @ umich
  1. You ARE your institution
  2. Need to continue the legacy

**- Checked in w. Mia**

She is going to send me her CV draft & application essays to look over. She plans to have 3 figures done by the end of next Friday.

#2019/02/07

**- Authorship paper**

Read Quadlin, 2018 "The Mark of a Woman's Record: Gender and Academic Performance in Hiring"

**- DEI Cert**

one-on-one w/ Nichole Burnside of my IDI results & submitted a reflection form. Suggestions to further develop my intercultural competence:
  + Language classes & workshops at the hospital
  + Rosetta stone from UM library
  + Books & podcasts on/from other cultures
  + Travel to conferences for URM

**- Dept DEI**

Meet w. Josie to discuss presentation. Started collaborative box to work on the presentation folder. Brainstormed some possible questions and strategized responses.
    
#2019/02/06

**- Dept DEI**

Generated several figures based on the three questions belows & finished a rough draft of the presentation.

I'd like to know the demographics of our current grad students & postdocs. Does who they see match who they are? Perhaps work that into the introduction. -- only 20% of trainees are WM

Also need to address the idea of representational vs aspirational -- balance the workload & the recognition

#2019/02/05

**- Dept DEI**

Worked on choosing visualizations for the faculty mtg presentation. Key question is: what do I want to show?

1. Is work distributed equally - e.g. how many faculty are hosting multiple times? What are those demographics?

2. What are the proportions of M/F, W/POC for invited speakers?

3. What are the proportions for lectureships?

Outline:
  + Introduction - DEI session at the retreat - Josie
  + Why does speaker diversity matter? - Ada/Josie
  + Methods - where did the data come from/demographic assignments - Ada
  + Results - demographic stats, lectureship stats
  + Conclusions - suggestions for improving speaker diversity moving forward

**- Lab meeting**

`ggplot(aes(x, color, y))+ geom_jitter(position=position_jitterdodge(jitter.width=0.1))`

**- Authorship paper**

Finished revising the genderize results section and added discussions of the editor comparison data and the countries with high proportion of na-gendered names from the full dataset.

**-ASM blog**

Made a few more tweaks to the non-ac careers post & sent off to Julie!

#2019/02/04

**- Authorship paper**

Read Bravo, et al., 2019 -- interestingly, they found that open peer review increased the objectivity and positivity of reviews from men.

Uploaded the new dataset to Box for Mia.

Started draft of "paper-in-progress" for the ASM representation paper

Worked on revising genderize results with updated validation dataset. Overall, the accuracy dropped a bit when I removed special characters, but the proportion of names that were assigned genders increased.

**- ASM blog**

Revised non-acc careers post & found new links.

**- Mia**

Car won't start, working from home.

**- "Git" Coffee w. Ari**

Apparently, she missed the git section w. Josh so I gave her an overview & got her started. We'll probably meet again to get her repos set up on GitHub.
