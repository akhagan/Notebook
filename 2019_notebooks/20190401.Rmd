Checked in on code. Worked on generalizing scripts. Need to figure out why `!!quo_group` isn't working for her.

#2019/04/11

**- Meet w. Meghan**

**- ASM blog**

Make suggestions to Jennifer's post.

**- Authorship paper**

Continue tweaking gender representation figures and add to `.rmd`.

Share `.rmd` with Pat.

**- Prep for Lab Meeting**

Share draft of genderize and gender results on Slack, along with paper-in-progress doc. Asked for big picture feedback:
    - does the evidence for the genderize analysis logically make sense? Is it sufficient?
    - given the details in (or alluded to in) the abbreviated notes, do the figures seem to give a complete picture of gender representation?  
    - what do you think should be made available in supplemental?

Read Fox and Paine, 2019. They found that slightly lower reviewer scores explained the difference in decisions on F-authored papers following peer review. Why did they not recommend discontinuation of review scores???!

Drafted an update to the dept DEI page & sent it to Harry, Akira, and Ann for comments.

Found a few different options for submissions. 

Drafted a rough outline & read some papers on the gender pay gap.
