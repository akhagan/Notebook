#2019/04/18

**- Dept DEI**

Made suggested changes to the website update.

**- Authorship paper**

Work on suggested changes to gender rep section
  Genderize
  + Highlight, draw attention to countries with gender-neutral naming conventions in plot
  + Histogram/density plot of names/country -- possibly show difference between before/after genderize
  + Graphic of global vs ASM ratios in supplemental
  + check & clarify what numbers are at the end of bars in genderize plots
  
Flux job finally terminated. Not all of the manuscripts are matching to grouped manuscript numbers for some reason. Also, I have to upload the csv of correct editor genders to flux.

Generated public/private keys & figured out how to mount flux so that I can add/remove docs. Also backed up my hard drive to flux.

Fixed issues with the dataset generating scripts & used Arc Connect!

Generated datasets ready for analysis & moved to hard drive. Need to re-generate the editor comparision csv for the genderize analysis.

Sent log regression table to Begum.

#2019/04/17

**- Gender bias**

Work on logistic regression table for impact of gender on publication.

**- Authorship paper**

Work on suggested changes to gender rep section
  Genderize
  + ~~Move genderize validation to methods & supplemental~~

  + ~~line plot of weighted editor proportions by journal~~
  + ~~drop graphic for comparision of senior author - potential rev - reviewer -- move that to the summary section~~ & add details in the text
  
  Summary
  + ~~Change publication rate disparity to acceptance rate disparity~~

**- Misc**

Read Pat's proposal

Plan next couple of weeks

Convince Begum to write a blog with me :D

**- Begum's upgoerfive abstract**

**- Prep for lab meeting**

**- Read Nick's paper**

**- Monthly journals report**

Transfered some ejp file & started a bash script to automate the process. Except you can't automate sftp w/out dealing w. pass keys.

Worked on adapting the xml parsing script to the new data from ejp & generated a df to work on remaining figures.

#2019/04/15

**-Gender bias paper**

Fig. 3 - Are papers authored by women ranked differently by reviewers? -- generated several figures to try to understand _what_ the ranking system is for each journal, not sure that I succeeded so I found the Instructions to Reviewers for the different journals on the shared drive. Also generated several figures trying to compare ranking by journal across genders. 
          + Does ranking correlate to impact (via citations)? -- need dois to answer this question
          
Fig. 4 - How does gender of author/reviewer/editor influence outcomes?
          + statistical regression (GRE papers)
          + Read up on logistical regression and started coercing gender data into a format for logistical regression. Having trouble with the factors. 
          + It might also be interesting to look at time to publish (days.pending) in terms of the hazard regression.
          + To convert reviewer gender into a logistical variable, I calculated the proportion of reveiewers that were men on each manuscript (using manu number, not grouped manu). Per Ryan's query that there might be a dose-dependent response, the scale ranged from "All men == 0" to "No men == 4". He also suggested looking up P tests for trends.

#2019/04/12

**- Gender bias**
    + figure 1, Is there a disparity in acceptance rates based on author gender? -- Consider looking at (or eliminating) paper withdrawal M/W
        + Across all ASM Journals
        + Split by journal
    + figure 2, Do papers authored by women take longer to get accepted than those authored by men?
        + Number of revisions
        + Time (in ASMâ€™s hands) from initial submission to acceptance

**- Mia**

Checked in on code. Worked on generalizing scripts. Need to figure out why `!!quo_group` isn't working for her.

#2019/04/11

**- Meet w. Meghan**

**- ASM blog**

Make suggestions to Jennifer's post.

**- Authorship paper**

Continue tweaking gender representation figures and add to `.rmd`.

Share `.rmd` with Pat.

**- Prep for Lab Meeting**

Share draft of genderize and gender results on Slack, along with paper-in-progress doc. Asked for big picture feedback:
    - does the evidence for the genderize analysis logically make sense? Is it sufficient?
    - given the details in (or alluded to in) the abbreviated notes, do the figures seem to give a complete picture of gender representation?  
    - what do you think should be made available in supplemental?

Read Paul, Bosu & Sultana, 2018; Applebaum, 2018
    
#2019/04/08

**- Authorship paper**

Read Fox and Paine, 2019. They found that slightly lower reviewer scores explained the difference in decisions on F-authored papers following peer review. Why did they not recommend discontinuation of review scores???!

**- Department DEI**

Drafted an update to the dept DEI page & sent it to Harry, Akira, and Ann for comments.

**- Meet w. Harry @ 3pm**

Found a few different options for submissions. 

Drafted a rough outline & read some papers on the gender pay gap.

A good review: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0095399716636928

He seems semi-interested. Gonna have to bug him about it.

Checked out CrossRef APIs. CrossRef has a number of APIs and search functions (https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/). They also have a tool (Metadata Plus), for production services - Need to check if ASM has this & if I can get access. 

There is also an API for reference linking - https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213420726

The REST API - https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc

An R interface for REST - https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref (installed package)

the OAI-PMH - https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213679866-OAI-PMH-subscriber-only-

OpenURL - https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/214880143-OpenURL

Query service accounts - https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/213198266-Query-service-accounts
