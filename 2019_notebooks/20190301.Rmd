**- SWC Python**

Anaconda is a collection of data science "packages" written in python.
+ Add strings together with "+" or multiply with "*"
+ "Type" has two characteristics: the data & the methods that can be applied to the data
+ autofill in python "name." gives list of actions that can be performed on that variable
+ Move order of cells by clicking on cell & using up/down arrows in the menu
+ Hit esc to toggle out to "command mode" then A to insert a cell above the cell you're in
+ delete a cell w. esc - X
+ Juypter supports markdown
+ Python can be used with either Python, R or Julia kernals
+ Rodeo - RStudio for Python
+ headers are important, glossaries are even better

```{r}
library(reticulate)
