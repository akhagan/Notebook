**- Misc**

Worked on booking flight to DC for EiC meeting.

**- Authorship paper**

Finished the script to scrape author names from the URLs & submitted as a batch script. Fingers crossed!

Doing it within a `mutate` wasn't working, so I had to create a new tibble & `cbind` to the original dataset.

**- SWC**

Working through the first part of the R lessons for the demo later. 

Demo - 

**- DEI Certificate**

Emailed to ask about IDI survey & workshop choice. Signed up for additional workshops.

**- Lab meeting**

Skimmed through Josh's materials for journal club. 

**- Authorship post**

Looks like the genderize script didn't run all of the names again. Probably run through it by hand. 
    + inspection reveals that of the 105,697 names run through genderize, only 44,370 are assigned genders.  
    + 85,751 unique name/country entries are run through with countries, but 57,896 are not assigned a gender
    + 21,314 are run through without country data, 4,716 don't recieve a gender (seems reasonable)
    + 42,862 names are above the threshold of 65% confidence
    + pull editors & group by gender, print for Mia to work on

Manuscript linking script completed & saved. 
    + looking at the num_matches document, 1,809 manuscripts don't have a matching grouped manuscript number?
    + Submit the script to fix the group manuscript numbers & see if that helps
    
Worked on webscraping authors from Nicole's dataset. Need to finish up the `get_author_function` b/c the `case_when` statement isn't working. Ryan suggested using the `x %in% y return(blah_y) x %in% z return(blah_z)` within an `sapply` function.

Succesfully mapped the function & pulled author's names!! Need to build in a `tryCatch` or something similar for when it doesn't work & will definitely need to submit as a batch script b/c it takes forever.

Following step is tidying the names & genders to match.

**- ASM blog post**

Made suggestions to Monika's post
