#2018/10/18

**- Journal Club**

Picked a paper for journal club next week. 

**- BA paper**

Went over & returned proofs for the petrobactin & sporulation paper. 

**- Thursday seminar**

**- Monthly journals report**

Finished the script to make all data fit across all variables. Successfully sourced six different scripts. There are two that need further development, then I need to move on to the more complicated stats & usage/citation stats.

#2018/10/17

**- Lab Meeting**

**- Authorship paper**

Ran final clean up to generate `csv` files for Mia. I will just have to change the last two editor genders (if at all), later.

**- Newsletter**

Edited draft of retreat write up.

**- ASM blog post**

Finished first draft (minus the conclusion) & sent it to Begum & Jesus for feedback. 

**- Our STEM**

Culled papers from email alerts.

#2018/10/16

**- ASM blog post**

Continued working on drafting the ergot post - added images, citations, and about 350 words.

**- Monthly journals report**

Finished cleaning up data for report-type analyisis & saved as a `csv` file. Started tweaking the analysis scripts to use the new dataset. Trying to write a function `test_list` to make all dataframes contain the same variables (e.g., journal or editor name) regardless of whether or not they have a variable value in that particular test. I'm stuck on getting `arrange` to recognize a column w/o specifically naming it. When that happens, I'll have 3 scripts completed.

#2018/10/15

**- Monthly journals report**

Pulled fresh usage & citation stats. Updated code for new datasets.

**- Authorship Paper**

Verified that all of the randomized group values were joined correctly.

Double checked names & genders from Mia's `csv` files. Seems that something weird happened when I generated the initial "unknown" list that mis-matched some names/institutions. Corrected those & sent two names to Pat to ask about. Also worked on the `verify_gender` script to correct mis-coded editors. Just waiting for the two other editors before we can move forward!

#2018/10/11

**- Nick's Practice Talk**

**- Monthly Journals Report**

Have to figure out how to pull usage & citation stats more easily than Impact Vizor in order to automate the report. 

**- Estimated JIF**

Pulled from the web of science with the following search criteria:
  + SO=(Molecular "AND" CELLULAR BIOLOGY OR MICROBIOLOGY "AND" MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REVIEWS OR JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY "AND" BIOLOGY EDUCATION OR MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM OR MICROBIOLOGY RESOURCE ANNOUNCEMENTS OR ECOSAL PLUS OR GENOME ANNOUNCEMENTS OR INFECTION "AND" IMMUNITY OR APPLIED "AND" ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY OR CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS OR CLINICAL "AND" VACCINE IMMUNOLOGY OR MBIO OR JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY OR JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY OR JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY OR mSystems OR mSphere) AND PY=(2016 OR 2017) 
  + A citation report was generated and the data downloaded into excel files, 500 at a time  

Might need to pull all ASM publications from Impact Vizor, so I can determine the type of manuscripts & thus whether their citations "count" or not.

**- Authorship paper**

Finished writing a script to randomize manuscript numbers & link them into a grouped, randomized manuscript number. Also wrote code to assign randomized person.ids. 

Completed a workflow to clean & deidentify all of the data to get it ready for analysis. Only potentially identifying things left are the person's institutions & dates of submission/reciept/publication. The next step is to finish assigning gender to the editors & then we're done & ready to analyze!! (though I am running a script to verify that all of the randomized manu numbers were matched into single grouped random manu numbers). 

#2018/10/10

**- Authorship paper**

Mia kept working on adding names to the unknown editors list.

I worked on finishing up the workflow to try to anonymize the data. 

**- Our STEM**

Begum gave me the idea to start a weekly digest similar to Bik's microbiome digest, but centered around bias and diversity in STEM fields, academia, & journals. This morning I set up an email address with several RSS & ToC subscriptions. I plan to host the site from Github, though I have to decide whether or not to buy a domain name.

#2018/10/09

**- JCM & AEM Follow up**

Emailed papers with citation data to EiCs of JCM & AEM per their request at Microbe.

**- DEI certificate (Inclusive leadership)**

Traits of inclusive leader - the 6 C's:
  + Commitment - willing to invest time/energy/resources
  + Courage
      + be vulnerable
      + brave enough to distract harm
  + Cognizance of Bias
      + recognize their own biases 
      + realize the biases can narrow their field of vision
  + Curiosity 
      + open minded, 
      + seek other perspectives, 
      + always learning/innovating, 
      + active listener
      + important to remember that some people need time to process before responding
  + Cultural Intelligence 
      + confident & effective in cross cultural interactions

      + also need to be aware that your experiences may have been wrong/don't fit in a setting
  + Collaboration
      + seek TRUE collaboration
      + empowers individuals
      + diversity will make the end result of complex problems better, but it will NOT be faster

Practices of inclusive leader:
  + Set the stage for an inclusive environment - Universal Design
      + Representation (WHAT) - provide multiple means of representation to address the WHAT of learning (various ways to learn/acquire info)
      + Action & Expression (HOW) - provide multiple means of action & expression to support the HOW of learning
      + Engagement (WHY) - multiple means of engagement to answer the WHY of learning
  + Begin by establishing community/trust
      + survey in advance for intentional design of group activities
      + start with ice breakers and/or introductions
      + allow participants to identify their preferred names & pronunciation
      + gender pronouns on name tags
      + share your workshop discussion guidelines
      + be incremental 
      + community guidelines
      + share personal stories
  + Model inclusive behaviors
      + 
  + Liberating structures
      + "easy-to-learn microstructures that enhance relational coordination and trust. they quidkly foster lively participation in groups of any size, making it possible to truly include & unleash everyone"
      + in other words... timed, flexible facilitation techniques that maximize inclusion and can be easily adapted
      + liberating structures are a set of practices that make it possible for everyone to have a voice & for everyone to engage & seize opportunities
      + ALL voices matter!

Why it matters:
  + FYI: there are systemic & structural barriers to inclusive leadership

#2018/10/05

**- DEI workshop**

Submitted my reflection form for the bystander intervention training.

#2018/10/04

**- DEI workshop**

"Change it up""  - Bystander Intervention

notes:
  + think about a time when you were a witness of harm - happened/feel/intervene or not? why?
  + it isn't always easy, some "harm" occurs in spaces that are difficult to intervene in or where intervening may cause more harm
  + what is our role? what is my goal?
  + intervention methods provide the tools/skills for you to decide based on the context
  + bystander can even be when someone tells you about an event, not just witnessing
  + this is a lot like parenting?
  
blueprint
  + Notice a problem
      + identities impact what you notice
      + what do I think about alot? (every interaction is a reminder of how you don't fit)
      + what I don't think about 
      + "Sometimes you're a caterpillar" - youtube video
      + not pushing into areas where we're unsafe, but perhaps uncomfortable
      + "entitlement"
  + Assume responsiblity
      + motivation - what would motivate you to change it up?
      + structure the practice: choose a "harm" that you often notice, make a plan & follow through
  + Think it through
      + physical & emotional safety - how will identities impact the situation? are there others around to support you? what power dynamics are at play?
      + effectiveness - are people going to listen to what you have to say?
  + change it up!
  
Toolkit
  + Direct - confront the situation right away
  + Distract - create a diversion to interrupt the situation
  + Delegate - tell someone else (friend, prof, coworker) & decide together how to intervene
  + Delay - Check in later wtih those who were involved

**- Authorship paper**

I think I actually have a working webscraping script. I created a lot of conditionals to allow the different functions to be more flexible. Submitted as a batch script.

**- ASM blog post**

Finish research & outlining the ergot post.

#2018/10/03

**- ASM blog post**

Worked on research & outline for the ergot post.

**- Authorship paper**

Webscraping script errored out part way through b/c it tried to add "http://" to a link that already had "https://". Fixed that but then realized in some cases, pubmed stores the doi  in a wierd location. I ran the script anyway, but I'll probably have to fix it to run those that error out.

Less than 100 URLs succesfully ran, I figured out one problem (passing the journal name to the `some_journals` function), but not all pubmed entries have a doi (e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9396779), so I have to figure out a back up for that.

**- Misc**

Booked flight to DC.

#2018/10/02

**- Misc**

Worked on booking flight to DC for EiC meeting.

**- Authorship paper**

Finished the script to scrape author names from the URLs & submitted as a batch script. Fingers crossed!

Doing it within a `mutate` wasn't working, so I had to create a new tibble & `cbind` to the original dataset.

**- SWC**

Working through the first part of the R lessons for the demo later. 

Demo - 

**- DEI Certificate**

Emailed to ask about IDI survey & workshop choice. Signed up for additional workshops.

2018/10/01

**- Lab meeting**

Skimmed through Josh's materials for journal club. 

**- Authorship post**

Looks like the genderize script didn't run all of the names again. Probably run through it by hand. 
    + inspection reveals that of the 105,697 names run through genderize, only 44,370 are assigned genders.  
    + 85,751 unique name/country entries are run through with countries, but 57,896 are not assigned a gender
    + 21,314 are run through without country data, 4,716 don't recieve a gender (seems reasonable)
    + 42,862 names are above the threshold of 65% confidence
    + pull editors & group by gender, print for Mia to work on

Manuscript linking script completed & saved. 
    + looking at the num_matches document, 1,809 manuscripts don't have a matching grouped manuscript number?
    + Submit the script to fix the group manuscript numbers & see if that helps
    
Worked on webscraping authors from Nicole's dataset. Need to finish up the `get_author_function` b/c the `case_when` statement isn't working. Ryan suggested using the `x %in% y return(blah_y) x %in% z return(blah_z)` within an `sapply` function.

Succesfully mapped the function & pulled author's names!! Need to build in a `tryCatch` or something similar for when it doesn't work & will definitely need to submit as a batch script b/c it takes forever.

Following step is tidying the names & genders to match.
