#2018/10/05

**- DEI workshop**

Submitted my reflection form for the bystander intervention training.

#2018/10/04

**- DEI workshop**

"Change it up""  - Bystander Intervention

notes:
  + think about a time when you were a witness of harm - happened/feel/intervene or not? why?
  + it isn't always easy, some "harm" occurs in spaces that are difficult to intervene in or where intervening may cause more harm
  + what is our role? what is my goal?
  + intervention methods provide the tools/skills for you to decide based on the context
  + bystander can even be when someone tells you about an event, not just witnessing
  + this is a lot like parenting?
  
blueprint
  + Notice a problem
      + identities impact what you notice
      + what do I think about alot? (every interaction is a reminder of how you don't fit)
      + what I don't think about 
      + "Sometimes you're a caterpillar" - youtube video
      + not pushing into areas where we're unsafe, but perhaps uncomfortable
      + "entitlement"
  + Assume responsiblity
      + motivation - what would motivate you to change it up?
      + structure the practice: choose a "harm" that you often notice, make a plan & follow through
  + Think it through
      + physical & emotional safety - how will identities impact the situation? are there others around to support you? what power dynamics are at play?
      + effectiveness - are people going to listen to what you have to say?
  + change it up!
  
Toolkit
  + Direct - confront the situation right away
  + Distract - create a diversion to interrupt the situation
  + Delegate - tell someone else (friend, prof, coworker) & decide together how to intervene
  + Delay - Check in later wtih those who were involved

**- Authorship paper**

I think I actually have a working webscraping script. I created a lot of conditionals to allow the different functions to be more flexible. Submitted as a batch script.

**- ASM blog post**

Finish research & outlining the ergot post.

#2018/10/03

**- ASM blog post**

Worked on research & outline for the ergot post.

**- Authorship paper**

Webscraping script errored out part way through b/c it tried to add "http://" to a link that already had "https://". Fixed that but then realized in some cases, pubmed stores the doi  in a wierd location. I ran the script anyway, but I'll probably have to fix it to run those that error out.

Less than 100 URLs succesfully ran, I figured out one problem (passing the journal name to the `some_journals` function), but not all pubmed entries have a doi (e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9396779), so I have to figure out a back up for that.

**- Misc**

Booked flight to DC.

#2018/10/02

**- Misc**

Worked on booking flight to DC for EiC meeting.

**- Authorship paper**

Finished the script to scrape author names from the URLs & submitted as a batch script. Fingers crossed!

Doing it within a `mutate` wasn't working, so I had to create a new tibble & `cbind` to the original dataset.

**- SWC**

Working through the first part of the R lessons for the demo later. 

Demo - 

**- DEI Certificate**

Emailed to ask about IDI survey & workshop choice. Signed up for additional workshops.

2018/10/01

**- Lab meeting**

Skimmed through Josh's materials for journal club. 

**- Authorship post**

Looks like the genderize script didn't run all of the names again. Probably run through it by hand. 
    + inspection reveals that of the 105,697 names run through genderize, only 44,370 are assigned genders.  
    + 85,751 unique name/country entries are run through with countries, but 57,896 are not assigned a gender
    + 21,314 are run through without country data, 4,716 don't recieve a gender (seems reasonable)
    + 42,862 names are above the threshold of 65% confidence
    + pull editors & group by gender, print for Mia to work on

Manuscript linking script completed & saved. 
    + looking at the num_matches document, 1,809 manuscripts don't have a matching grouped manuscript number?
    + Submit the script to fix the group manuscript numbers & see if that helps
    
Worked on webscraping authors from Nicole's dataset. Need to finish up the `get_author_function` b/c the `case_when` statement isn't working. Ryan suggested using the `x %in% y return(blah_y) x %in% z return(blah_z)` within an `sapply` function.

Succesfully mapped the function & pulled author's names!! Need to build in a `tryCatch` or something similar for when it doesn't work & will definitely need to submit as a batch script b/c it takes forever.

Following step is tidying the names & genders to match.
