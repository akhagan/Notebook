Fill out application & read setup material.

**- Lab lunch**

**- ASM blog post**

Make suggestions for Jennifer's infant microbiome & gut/brain axis post.

**- Authorship paper**

Worked on troubleshooting linking manuscripts. It seems that there are at least 52 instances where a single manuscript is a "related manuscript" for multiple other manuscripts and end up with two matching `grouped_manu_numbers`. There's also one instance where three `grouped_manu_numbers` are identified. I'm not sure how to remedy this, or if it's even necessary...

#2018/08/23

**- Lab meeting**

**- Meet with Pat**

**- Code review**

Worked on presentation for code review on XML docs & R. Sample dataset on nutritional value of foods.

**- ASM blog post**

Re-read & made suggestions to Jennifer's yeast post.

#2018/08/22

**- BA manuscript**

Met with Phil. We're going to submit to mSphere Direct. Work on manuscript revisions and response to reviewers.

**- Monthly journals report**

Work on standardizing scripts. Working out bugs. Filling in Rmd.

**- Authorship paper**

Genderize script seems to have run without issue. Only threw two 502 errors. 

`link_xml` script appeared to have run, and saved a csv file. However, the csv only has a single line and the script printout has an error `Error in stream_delim_(df, path, ...) : Don't know how to handle vector of type list.` Was using the wrong `map` function so it couldn't save the output correctly. Fixed & restarted pbs script.

`link_xml` script errored again `Evaluation error: Result 2055 is not a length 1 atomic vector.`

#2018/08/21

**- Monthly journals report**

Trying to figure out why the percentages in the accept/reject rates aren't adding up. In part it's because the manuscripts aren't linked so the revise decisions are being counted in the total. Ended up only selecting accepts & rejects.

Need to filter by year.

**- Authorship paper**

Apparently `case_when` can't handle empty variables. Replaced with an `if/else` statement. Submitted jobs to link the xml files & attempt to genderize names.

#2018/08/20

**- Authorship paper**

Work on cleaning up link manuscript script. Having trouble getting the `case_when` statement to catch errors. Asked question about it on Stack Overflow. 

**- ASM blog post**

Edits/suggestions to Jennifer's yeast post.
