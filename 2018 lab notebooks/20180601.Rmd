**- Journals Board Meeting**



**- AEM**

Harold wants to know the impact by country of origin (# citations per country normalized to the # papers published by that country). That data is in the XML files but doesn't seem to be carried into Impact Vizor.

**- JCM Meeting**

JCM is interested in editor specific statistics: "For each editor, a list of papers they edited during 2015-2016, with the number of times each was cited? Let me know if it's too cumbersome or otherwise problematic"

**- Meet with Melissa**

Email dates for August meeting!

Talk about revamping the montly report. EJP reports are tricky b/c the documentations & parameter options aren't great. Currently Melissa does the reports for all journals except mBio manually. Some of the reports are multijournals, others have to be done on a per journal basis. On the whole it is pretty tedious. The mBio report is done by Maisha with some different stats. Melissa is going to note the parameters she uses.

Stats needed:
  + submissions
  + personal work loads (e.g., editor / EiC level stats)
  + acceptance rates
  + problem manuscripts (those that have been sitting in pergatory for a while, generally with the author)
  + citations reporting (e.g. like those I've included in the rejected article tracker)
  + other stats to help monitor editors, journal trends, themes, trend data, etc. - see mBio for ideas/template
  + Useage stats (from highwire, which pulls from scopus)
  
Starter task is to pick one journal to do a sample report on & circulate to the EiCs then refine based on input. Probably start with Impact Vizor data & highwire reports to decide layout, etc then work backwards to the long term plan, which maybe to pull XML files continuously from eJP to update data.
