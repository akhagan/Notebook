**- Prepping for Lab Meeting**

Wrote up an Rmarkdown with an explanation and all of the code for Code Review at lab meeting. 

**- Science Editor Seminar**

**- E.M. Blackwell**

Picked up & skimmed through "A Century of Mycology" for references. Didn't find much despite Webster mentioning other female BMS presidents who were _wives_ of other presidents/founding members?

**- XML parsing**

Saved `all_manu` as a csv file and started fresh script to import then work on building function to link manuscripts. I think I have something close. I have a `repeat` wrapping an `if else` with lots of pasting. 

**- Finish editing ASM blog post**
