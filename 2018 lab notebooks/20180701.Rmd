**- ASM blog post**

Worked on research about bathing infants and the microbiome.

**- Set up new laptop**

Installed gitcola, R, R studio, slack, etc. Cloned github repositories. Also installed a couple of productivity tools: a notepad & task/timer app

**- emailed with Tyler about WoS API**

He sent links to documentation about the APIs & is going to check on which one we subscribe to. I think Pat was using the AMR, I asked him for the API key.
