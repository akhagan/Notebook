**- estimated JIF**

Work on finding WoS API script for R. Can only find `wosr` which interfaces with InCite & WoS Web Services lite. Can't find one for the AMR api yet. Might have to build this interface from scratch. 

**- ASM blog post**

**- Summer strategic goals**

Sick, email goals to Pat.

**- work on genderize.io script**

Automated it to skip errors & repeat N/A names without a country code. 

Need to find a way to deal with the special characters again.

**- Work on summer strategic goals**

**- ASM blog post**

Work on Microbial Myths post.

#2018/07/09

**- ASM blog post**

Worked on research about bathing infants and the microbiome.

**- Set up new laptop**

Installed gitcola, R, R studio, slack, etc. Cloned github repositories. Also installed a couple of productivity tools: a notepad & task/timer app

**- emailed with Tyler about WoS API**

He sent links to documentation about the APIs & is going to check on which one we subscribe to. I think Pat was using the AMR, I asked him for the API key.
