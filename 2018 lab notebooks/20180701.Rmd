**- Authorship Paper**

Started Rmd file, imported Zotero bibliography, started `.bib` and `.csl` files.

**- Flux scale up**

Having trouble with the `parse_manu` function in the scale up. So I decided to write a function that randomly samples and parses XML files then returns a success/error message along with the file name so I can trouble shoot. So far it isn't working... However, it won't actually handle the errors, and the `case_when` returns a random number of identical results.

**- Journals report**

Emailed Joel about eJP access again. Emailed Adar to ask about a login to the eJP site.

Draft outline of reports. 

Joel said to call whenever works. 

**- Genderize.io script**

Finished script, fixed conversion from html special characters to text. Will still have to revisit to: 
  
  1. Double check that all entered names are being queried
  2. Figure out why I'm getting `400` errors

#2018/07/12

**- Journal Club paper**

**- Lab meeting**

#2018/07/11

**- estimated JIF**

Work on finding WoS API script for R. Can only find `wosr` which interfaces with InCite & WoS Web Services lite. Can't find one for the AMR api yet. Might have to build this interface from scratch. 

**- ASM blog post**

**- Summer strategic goals**

Sick, email goals to Pat. 

#2018/07/10

**- work on genderize.io script**

Automated it to skip errors & repeat N/A names without a country code. 

Need to find a way to deal with the special characters again.

**- Work on summer strategic goals**

**- ASM blog post**

Work on Microbial Myths post.

#2018/07/09

**- ASM blog post**

Worked on research about bathing infants and the microbiome.

**- Set up new laptop**

Installed gitcola, R, R studio, slack, etc. Cloned github repositories. Also installed a couple of productivity tools: a notepad & task/timer app

**- emailed with Tyler about WoS API**

He sent links to documentation about the APIs & is going to check on which one we subscribe to. I think Pat was using the AMR, I asked him for the API key.
