#2018/11/15

**- ASM blog post**

Suggestions for Rita's post.

**- Authorship paper**

Worked on generating figures for the representation paper. Have to decide if I should show gender proportions in both submissions & publications or just one?

Generated a list of >2,000 names with gender attached from Nichole's dataset & ran them through genderize for a comparison. Need to figure out how best to demonstrate the differences. Calculated the Pmod (Edwards, 2018)

**- DEI certificate**

Submitted reflection for yesterdays workshop.

#2018/11/14

**- "Multiculturalism, Inclusion & Career Development"**

**- Authorship paper**

Worked on webscraping script & resubmitted the job to flux. (x3)

List of figures for gender representation: 
  + gender of all editors over time
   
  + ~~breakdown into editor type: e.g., EiC, senior, associate?~~
   
  + gender of all reviewers over time
   
  + gender of all senior/corresponding authors over time
   
  + gender of all first authors over time
   
  + gender of all authors
   
  + proportion of gender at each stage: e.g., author, reviewer, editor by type
   
  + invited manuscripts by gender
   
  + male/female dominated categories? journals?

#2018/11/13

**- Authorship paper**

Tried something to fix the input/output issue with the webscraping script & resubmitted to flux.

Wrote script to match names & genders from Nichole's dataset given the output. Just need to increase the number of names I get from the webscrapting script. 

Worked on troubleshooting the various URLs that are erroring out & found one issue: I have a `case_when` statement that is giving me problems. Given the URL value below, the `case_when` _should_ return a value of "plos". Unfortunately, it is instead evaluating the first expression (`read_html(URL)...`) despite returning a "FALSE" value for `str_detect(URL, "pubmed")`. It doesn't seem to matter whether I place that line before or after `str_detect(URL, "plos")`. Figured out a way around it. 

**- ASM blog post**

Finished the first draft of the careers post & sent it to Josie for feedback. I wasn't quite able to fit in the NIH stance on effort, but I might after I see what she thinks.

**- Monthly journals report**

Work on further developing the code for the monthly report. Found a description of how to automate `Rmd` files so I think I'll write a script to load in the data & functions, generate the monthly report for all journals and then individual reports for each of the journals.
